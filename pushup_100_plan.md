# 100 Push-Up Daily Plan

**Start Date:** Monday, 9 Feb 2026  
**Goal:** Reach 100 push-ups in one unbroken set in ~8–12 weeks.  
**Gym:** Keep following your existing 6-day workout routine.

---

## How to Use This Plan

- Push-up sessions are planned for **Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat**. Other days: focus on normal gym work and recovery.
- Always do **2–3 light warm-up sets** (8–12 easy push-ups) before the day’s main work.
- Maintain **perfect form**: full range of motion, tight core, no sagging hips.
- If a day feels too hard, reduce reps by 2–3 per set and complete the structure.

- Warm up well (3–4 light sets, dynamic shoulders).

- Push-ups:
  - 60–80 total reps in mini-sets of 15–20 with short rests.

### Saturday or Monday (Next Week) – Second 100 Attempt

  - Be well rested (good sleep, no heavy pushing 48h before).
  - Warm up and attempt **100 in a single set** again.

Other days in Week 8: no intense push-up work.

---

## After Week 8

- If you’ve hit 100, maintain with **2 push-up sessions/week** (1 heavy, 1 light).
- If you’re close (80–95), repeat Weeks **7–8** once more, then test again.

Track your daily work and results under each day in this file if you want (e.g., note actual reps, how you felt, and your best single-set max each week).
