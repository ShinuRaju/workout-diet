# 100 Push-Up Daily Plan

**Start Date:** Monday, 9 Feb 2026  
**Goal:** Reach 100 push-ups in one unbroken set in ~8–12 weeks.  
**Gym:** Mon/Tue/Wed at gym, Thu/Fri at Cult.fit, Sat bodyweight, Sun rest.

---

## How to Use This Plan

- Push-up sessions are planned for **Mon, Wed, Thu, Fri**. Saturday's 50 pushups (from your bodyweight routine) count as easy volume.
- **Mon & Wed:** Do push-up work **after** your gym workout.
- **Thu & Fri:** Do push-up work **at home before** Cult.fit class. These 100 pushups follow the plan's structure — not random reps.
- Always do **2–3 light warm-up sets** (8–12 easy push-ups) before the day’s main work.
- Maintain **perfect form**: full range of motion, tight core, no sagging hips.
- If a day feels too hard, reduce reps by 2–3 per set and complete the structure.
