# 200 Squat Single Set Plan

**Start Date:** Tuesday, 17 Feb 2026  
**Goal:** Reach 200 bodyweight squats in one unbroken set in ~8–10 weeks.  
**Gym:** Mon/Tue/Wed at gym, Thu/Fri at Cult.fit, Sat bodyweight, Sun rest.

---

## How to Use This Plan

- Squat endurance sessions are planned for **Tue, Thu, Fri, Sat**. These won't interfere with heavy barbell squats on Leg day.
- **Tue:** Squat work **after** gym (Back + Biceps day — legs are fresh).
- **Thu:** Squat work **before** Cult.fit Upper Body class (upper body class won't need your legs).
- **Fri:** Squat work **after** Cult.fit Lower Body class (don't fatigue legs before a coached lower body session).
- **Sat:** Built into your bodyweight routine.
- Always do **2–3 light warm-up sets** (15–20 easy squats + leg swings) before main work.
- Maintain **proper form**: thighs at least parallel, chest up, knees tracking over toes, full lockout at top.
- If a day feels too hard, reduce reps by 5–10 per set and complete the structure.
- **Avoid heavy squat endurance work on Wed (Leg + Shoulders gym day)** — keep legs fresh for barbell squats.

  - Rest **60–90 sec** between sets.

- Do **ONE all-out set** and go for **200 bodyweight squats**.
- **Pace yourself**: don't sprint the first 50. Find a steady rhythm.
- If you fall short (e.g., 160–190), write down the number — that's still incredible progress.
- After that, only **2–3 very easy sets of 15–20**.

### Thursday – Light Cluster (Before Cult.fit Upper Body)

### Sunday or Tuesday (Next Week) – Second 200 Attempt

- If you didn't hit 200 on Week 8 Tuesday, take another shot here:
  - Be well rested (good sleep, no heavy leg work 48h before).
  - Warm up and attempt **200 in a single set** again.

Other days in Week 8: no intense squat work.

## Tips for High-Rep Squats

- **Breathing:** Establish a rhythm — exhale on the way up, inhale on the way down.
- **Pacing:** Don't go fast early. A steady tempo of ~1 squat per second is sustainable.
- **Mental breaks:** At 100+ reps, pause briefly at the top (standing) for 1–2 breaths. Stay locked out — don't sit down or let your legs bend.
- **Hydration:** Have water nearby. Sip between mental breaks if needed.
- **Music/Counting:** Count in blocks of 25 or 50 to make it mentally manageable.

---

## After Week 8

- If you've hit 200, maintain with **2 squat endurance sessions/week** (1 heavy, 1 light).
- If you're close (170–199), repeat Weeks **7–8** once more, then test again.

Track your daily work and results under each day in this file (e.g., note actual reps, how you felt, and your best single-set max each week).
