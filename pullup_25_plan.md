# 25 Pull-Up Single Set Plan

**Start Date:** Tuesday, 17 Feb 2026  
**Goal:** Reach 25 strict pull-ups in one unbroken set in ~8–10 weeks.  
**Gym:** Mon/Tue/Wed at gym, Thu/Fri at Cult.fit, Sat bodyweight, Sun rest.

---

## How to Use This Plan

- Pull-up sessions are planned for **Tue, Wed, Thu, Sat**. Pull bar is available at the gym and at Cult.fit.
- **Tue:** Do pull-up work **during** your Back + Biceps gym workout (perfect synergy).
- **Wed:** Do pull-up work **after** your Legs + Shoulders gym workout (upper body is fresh).
- **Thu:** Do pull-up work **at Cult.fit** before or after your Upper Body Strength class.
- **Sat:** Your bodyweight routine already includes 25 pull-ups + 25 chin-ups — use this as your easy volume day.
- Always do **2–3 warm-up sets** (3–5 easy pull-ups or band-assisted) before main work.
- Maintain **strict form**: dead hang start, chin over bar, controlled descent, no kipping.
- If a day feels too hard, reduce reps by 1–2 per set and complete the structure.
- If you can't do 8+ pull-ups yet, use **band-assisted pull-ups** until you build up.
