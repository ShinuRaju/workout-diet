# Six-Pack Abs Diet Plan

## User Profile

- **Current Weight:** 100 kg
- **Height:** 6'2"
- **Body Fat:** > 30%
- **Goal:** Six-pack abs (Requires reducing body fat to ~10-12%)

## Strategy Overview

To achieve visible abs, you need to shed significant body fat while maintaining muscle mass. This requires a caloric deficit, high protein intake, and consistent training.

### Nutritional Guidelines

1.  **Caloric Deficit:** Your estimated maintenance calories are around 2,800 - 3,000 kcal. Aim for a target of **2,200 - 2,400 kcal** per day to lose weight steadily (0.5 - 1 kg per week).
2.  **High Protein:** Crucial for muscle retention and satiety. Aim for **2.0 - 2.2g of protein per kg of body weight** (approx. 200g - 220g daily).
3.  **Moderate Carbs:** Focus on complex carbs around workouts.
4.  **Healthy Fats:** Essential for hormone regulation.
5.  **Hydration:** Drink 4-5 liters of water daily.

## Important Rules

1.  **No Sugary Drinks:** Eliminate soda, fruit juices, and alcohol.
2.  **Cheat Meal:** One controlled cheat meal per week (not a cheat day) after the first 2 weeks.
3.  ** Consistency:** Meal prep on Sundays to avoid bad choices during the week.
4.  **Sleep:** Aim for 7-8 hours. Lack of sleep increases cortisol, which holds onto belly fat.
