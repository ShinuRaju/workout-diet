# Workout Routine (6:00 AM Start)

**Focus:** Fat Loss + Muscle Retention. Keep rest periods short (45-60 sec) to keep heart rate up.

## Schedule

- **Mon:** Chest + Triceps + Abs
- **Tue:** Back + Biceps + 20m Cardio
- **Wed:** Legs + Shoulders
- **Thu:** Cult.fit Upper Body Strength (100 pushups at home before class)

- **Sun:** Rest 🛑

## Guidelines

- **Warm-up:** 5 mins brisk walk/light jog + Dynamic stretching.
- **Warm-up Sets:** For compound lifts (Bench, Squat, Deadlift, OHP), do 2-3 ramp-up sets (e.g., empty bar x 10, 50% x 8, 75% x 5) before working sets.
- **Pre-Workout (Mon/Tue/Wed):** 500 skips (~5 mins) as dynamic warm-up before gym.
- **Pre-Workout (Thu/Fri — Cult.fit days):** 100 pushups at home before class. No skipping.
- **Sunday:** Complete rest. No training.
- **Cardio:** Do 15-20 mins _after_ weights, not before (save energy for lifting).
- **Progressive Overload:** When you hit the top of your rep range on all sets, increase weight by 2.5-5 lbs next session. Track every session.
- **Mind-Muscle Connection:** Focus on controlled eccentrics (2-3 sec lowering phase), especially on isolation moves.

## Recovery & Lifestyle (Non-Negotiables)

- **Sleep:** 7-9 hours. This is when muscle repairs. No compromise.
- **Hydration:** Minimum 3-4 liters/day. Add electrolytes on training days.
- **Stretching/Mobility:** 10 mins post-workout static stretching. Foam roll tight areas.
- **Deload Week:** Every 4-6 weeks, reduce weights by 40-50% for one week. Prevents burnout & injury.
